# Python Identifiers

- Identifier is the name given to entities like class, functions, variables etc. in Python. It helps differentiating one entity from another.
- Identifiers can be a combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore (_). Names like myClass, var_1 and print_this_to_screen, all are valid example.
- An identifier cannot start with a digit. 1variable is invalid, but variable1 is perfectly fine.
- Keywords cannot be used as identifiers.
- We cannot use special symbols like !, @, #, $, % etc. in our identifier.
- Identifier can be of any length.
