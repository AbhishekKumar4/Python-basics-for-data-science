# Variables

- Named location used to store data in the memory.
- Each variable must have a unique name called identifier.
- In Python we don't assign values to the variables, whereas Python gives the reference of the object (value) to the variable.
- In Python, variables do not need declaration to reserve memory space. The "variable declaration" or "variable initialization" happens automatically when we assign a value to a variable.
- Use the assignment operator = to assign the value to a variable.
- *Python is a type inferred language, it can automatically infer (know) Apple.com is a String and declare website as a String.*


# Constants

- A constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed.
- All in capital letters and underscores separating the words.(Just like java)
- In reality, we don't use constants in Python. The globals or constants module(module means a new file containing variables, functions etc which is imported to main file.) is used throughout the Python programs.


# Rules and Naming convention for variables and constants

- Use camelCase notation to declare a variable. It starts with lowercase letter.
- Use capital letters where possible to declare a constant.
- Never use special symbols like !, @, #, $, %, etc.
- Don't start name with a digit.
- Constants are put into Python modules and meant not be changed.
- Constant and variable names should have combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore (_).


# Literals

- Literal is a raw data given in a variable or constant.
