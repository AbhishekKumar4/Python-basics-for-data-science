# Statements, Indentation and Comments

**Rules for python statements**
 - End of a statement is marked by a newline character.
 - We can extend over multiple lines with the line continuation character (\)
 - We can implement the multi-line statement also by using ( ), brackets [ ] and braces { }.
 
 
 **Rules for Indentation**
 - C, C++, Java use braces { } to define a block of code. Python uses indentation.
 - A code block (body of a function, loop etc.) starts with indentation and **ends with the first unindented line.**
 
 **Python Comments**
 - we use the hash (#) symbol to start writing a comment.
 - If we have comments that extend multiple lines, one way of doing it is to use hash (#) in the beginning of each line.
 - Another way of making multiline comments is to use triple quotes, either ''' or """.
