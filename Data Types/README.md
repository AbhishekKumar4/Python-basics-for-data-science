# Data Types

- Every value in Python has a datatype.
- Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are actually classes and variables are instance (object) of these classes.
- In Python, we don’t need to declare a variable with explicitly mentioning the data type. This feature is famously known as dynamic typing.
- Python determines the type of a literal directly from the syntax at runtime. For example – the quotes mark the declaration of a string value, square brackets represent a list and curly brackets for a dictionary.

# Python data types
 - Booleans
 - Numbers
 - Strings
 - Bytes
 - Lists
 - Tuples
 - Sets
 - Dictionaries
 
 # Booleans
  - Boolean in Python can have two values – True or False.
  - In some cases, the boolean constants “True” and “False” might also act as numbers.
  
  ```
  >>> A, B = True + 0, False + 0
  >>> print(A, B)
  1 0
  ```
  
  - It is evident from the above example that True is 1 and the value of False is 0. And they will turn into numbers during arithmetic operations.
