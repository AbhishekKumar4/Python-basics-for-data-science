# Data Types

- Every value in Python has a datatype.
- Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are actually classes and variables are instance (object) of these classes.
- In Python, we don’t need to declare a variable with explicitly mentioning the data type. This feature is famously known as dynamic typing.
- Python determines the type of a literal directly from the syntax at runtime. For example – the quotes mark the declaration of a string value, square brackets represent a list and curly brackets for a dictionary.
